Profile=========
The Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited (HDFC) was amongst the first to receive an 'in principle' approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to set up a bank in the private sector, as part of RBI's liberalisation of the Indian Banking Industry in 1994. The bank was incorporated in August 1994 in the name of 'HDFC Bank Limited', with its registered office in Mumbai, India. HDFC Bank commenced operations as a Scheduled Commercial Bank in January 1995.


Awards=========
HDFC Bank began operations in 1995 with a simple mission: to be a "World-class Indian Bank". We realised that only a single-minded focus on product quality and service excellence would help us get there. Today, we are proud to say that we are well on our way towards that goal.

It is extremely gratifying that our efforts towards providing customer convenience have been appreciated both nationally and internationally.


finiancial info============
The last eighteen years have been very fulfilling. We can of course wax eloquent about it in so many ways, but they say, figures don't lie, so we will let the figures do all the talking. They will give you a fair idea of how we have grown in the past few years.
